# BlitzVault — Sprint Week 2 (3 Developers)

> **Week:** Mon 2 Jun – Fri 6 Jun 2026
> **Based on:** repo state after Week 1 merge (Phase 0 complete)
> **Aligns with:** `docs/roadmap.md` Phase 1 — Core File System

---

## Week goal

Ship a **working drive**: upload a file to object storage and see it (with a
thumbnail) in the grid; create/rename/move/delete folders. Persisted in
Postgres + S3/R2 (MinIO locally). No sharing/permissions yet.

| By Friday EOD | Owner |
|---|---|
| `StorageAdapter` impl (S3/R2) + presigned upload/download | Dev1 |
| `POST /files/upload/init` + `/complete`; folder CRUD endpoints | Dev1 |
| File grid wired to real API; uploader with progress; optimistic rename/delete | Dev2 |
| MinIO in compose; thumbnail worker (BullMQ); upload rate limits | Dev3 |
| Contract: upload init/complete + folder CRUD frozen (Tue) | Dev1 + Dev2 |

---

## Phase focus this week

| Phase | Scope this week | Stretch (Fri only) |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** — Core file system | **Primary (Mon–Fri)** | Resumable/multipart upload spike |
| **Phase 2** — Authorization | Out of scope (entities only must stay FGA-ready) | — |

**Out of scope this week:** OpenFGA, sharing, workspaces, realtime, AI, search,
file versioning UI.

---

## Carry-over from Week 1 (fix early)

| Item | Why | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `node dist/server.js` start broken (TypeORM `.ts` migration glob) | blocks real/prod start; only `ts-node` dev works | Dev1 (Mon) |
| Trivy `@master` unpinned | reproducibility — pin to the tag the green run used | Dev3 (Mon) |
| Staging not provisioned | needed before Phase 1 can be demoed off-localhost | Dev3 (stretch) |

---

## Starting point (already in repo)

| Done (Week 1) | Gap (Week 2 fills) |
|---|---|
| `Files` + `Folders` entities + migration `0003` | No file/folder write endpoints (folders = list only) |
| `StorageAdapter` **interface** (`shared/services/storage.adapter.ts`) | No concrete adapter (throws "not implemented") |
| `fileUploadInitSchema`, `folderCreate/List` Zod | No upload complete / folder mutate schemas |
| Drive grid + empty state + card + `useDriveList` (mock data) | Not wired to real API; no uploader |
| BullMQ demo worker spike (`workers/index.ts`) | No real thumbnail/processing worker |
| Redis rate limit (`strict`/`default` tiers) | No `write` tier applied to uploads |
| Redis + Mailpit in compose | No MinIO (local S3) |

---

## Developer roles (fixed for the week)

| Dev | Focus | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev1** | Backend / storage | Storage adapter, upload endpoints, folder CRUD, file service |
| **Dev2** | Frontend / UX | File grid (real data), uploader + progress, optimistic mutations |
| **Dev3** | DevOps / workers | MinIO, thumbnail worker, upload rate limits, CI for workers |

---

## Day-by-day overview

### Monday — Storage adapter + carry-overs

| Dev | Tasks | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev1** | Implement `S3Adapter` (presigned PUT/GET, delete) behind `StorageAdapter`; `createStorageAdapter()` selects via env (`STORAGE_DRIVER`); fix `node dist` start | Adapter unit-tested against MinIO |
| **Dev2** | Replace drive mock with real `useDriveList` query against `/folders`; loading/empty/error states real | Grid renders live (empty) data |
| **Dev3** | Add MinIO to `docker-compose.dev.yml` (+ bucket bootstrap); pin Trivy action tag; storage env vars in `.env.example` + `environments.md` | `mc`/console reachable; bucket exists |

**15-min sync:** storage key scheme (`workspaces/{ws}/files/{fileId}`), env var names.

---

### Tuesday — Upload contract freeze + endpoints

| Dev | Tasks | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev1** | `POST /files/upload/init` (presigned PUT + idempotency key) and `/complete` (verify ETag/checksum → write `File` row); export Zod for both | **Frozen upload contract** |
| **Dev2** | Uploader component: pick file → call `init` → PUT to presigned URL with XHR progress → `complete`; optimistic row in grid | Single file uploads E2E |
| **Dev3** | `write` rate-limit tier on `/files/upload/*`; CORS on bucket for browser PUT; worker scaffolding (`workers/thumbnail.ts`) | Uploads throttled; bucket CORS ok |

**30-min contract review:** Dev1 presents init/complete; Dev2 + Dev3 sign off.
**No upload schema changes after Tue without ADR.**

---

### Wednesday — Folder CRUD + grid actions

| Dev | Tasks | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev1** | Folder `create` / `rename` / `move` / soft-delete (`deleted_at`) endpoints; cursor pagination on list; validate move (no cycles) | Folder tree mutable via API |
| **Dev2** | Create-folder modal; rename/delete with optimistic update + rollback on error; breadcrumb navigation into folders | Folder ops feel instant |
| **Dev3** | Thumbnail worker: on `complete`, enqueue job → generate thumbnail → store + update `File.thumbnail_key` | Image uploads get thumbnails |

**Integration test (all):** upload image → appears in grid → thumbnail renders.

---

### Thursday — Download, delete, polish

| Dev | Tasks | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev1** | `GET /files/:id/download` (presigned GET); file soft-delete + restore stub; list files within a folder | Download works; files listable |
| **Dev2** | Download action; file/folder context menu (rename/move/delete/download); drag-to-upload zone | Full grid interactions |
| **Dev3** | Worker in CI (lint/typecheck); MinIO service in upload integration test job; AV-scan stub job | Workers covered by CI |

---

### Friday — Tests, buffer, demo

| Dev | Tasks | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Dev1** | Integration tests: upload init/complete, folder CRUD (against MinIO + PG); OpenAPI docs updated for new endpoints | Green tests; live docs |
| **Dev2** | Empty/error/skeleton polish; a11y on uploader + menus; mobile grid | Polished drive |
| **Dev3** | Trivy scan still clean (new deps); thumbnail worker smoke in CI; deploy/staging doc update | Security + infra green |

**Demo (4pm):** upload image → thumbnail in grid → rename folder → move file →
download → delete. CI green.

## Developer-wise detailed breakdown

### Dev1 — Backend / storage

| Day | Task | Files / areas | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | S3/R2 adapter | `shared/services/storage/*` | Presigned PUT/GET work vs MinIO |
| Mon | Fix dist start | `server.ts`, `config/db.ts` migrations glob | `node dist/server.js` boots |

| Wed | Folder CRUD | `features/folders/*` | create/rename/move/soft-delete + cursor list |
| Thu | Download + file list | `features/files/*` | Presigned GET; list by folder |
| Fri | Tests + OpenAPI | `tests/integration/*`, `shared/openapi/*` | ≥3 new passing tests; docs match |

## Parallel work rules

### Can run in parallel
- Dev1 adapter + Dev3 MinIO (different files)
- Dev2 uploader UI + Dev1 endpoints (contract frozen Tue)
- Dev3 worker + Dev1 file service

### Must sequence
- Upload contract (Tue) before FE uploader finalizes
- `File` row write (`/complete`) before thumbnail worker reads it
- MinIO + bucket CORS before browser direct-PUT works

### Branch strategy
- Branches: `feat/p1-<task>`
- PRs ≤400 LOC, one reviewer, conventional commits
- Merge order: **Dev1 → Dev3 → Dev2** daily
- Hooks: full check suite runs at **commit** (lefthook); push is fast

---
